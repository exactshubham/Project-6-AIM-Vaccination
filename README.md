# Project-AIM_Vaccination

- Vaccination Backend for User and Admin

## Preface :-
- This project is a backend system for managing COVID-19 vaccinations using Node.js, Express.js, Bcrypt, Mongoose, and JWT. The system allows users to create vaccination slots, view available slots, and book appointments for vaccinations. Admins can view all slots and bookings, as well as create new slots and update existing ones.

## Requirements: -
To run this project, you will need:

- Node.js

- MongoDB

## Getting Started:-

- Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/exactshubham/Project-6-AIM-Vaccination 

- Install dependencies: npm install

- Start the server: npm start

## Authentication:-
- This project uses JWT for authentication. To authenticate, send a POST request to /auth/login with a JSON payload containing your email and password.
- The server will respond with a JWT that you can include in subsequent requests as a bearer token in the Authorization header.

## Security:-
- This project uses Bcrypt to encrypt and store user passwords. Passwords are never stored in plaintext.

## Conclusion:-
- This project demonstrates my proficiency in Node.js, Express.js, Bcrypt, Mongoose, and JWT, as well as my ability to design and implement a complex system from start to finish. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me.





## Project Summary:-

- As a developer, I designed and implemented a backend system for managing COVID-19 vaccinations 

- Using tech stack like Node.js and Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Bcrypt, jsonwebtoken.

- The system allowed users to create vaccination slots, view available slots, and book appointments for vaccinations. 

- Admins could view all slots and bookings by users and able to get details of all users.

- To ensure the security of the system, I used Bcrypt to encrypt and store user passwords

  and JWT to handle user authentication and authorization.

- I also utilized Mongoose to connect to a MongoDB database, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of vaccination data.

- Throughout the project, I prioritized performance, scalability, and ease of use for both users and admins. 

- As a result, the system was able to handle a high volume of traffic and provided a seamless user experience.

- Overall, this project allowed me to hone my skills in Node.js, Express.js, Bcrypt, Mongoose, and JWT,

  as well as gain experience in designing and implementing a complex system from start to finish.
